Installation instructions for Scrupulous on Linux (tar.gz)
------------------------------------------------------

Scrupulous uses Python's Distutils tool for installation. By default,
it will install everything to /opt/scrupulous if you run

python setup.py install

Afterwards you can run the program with the command "/opt/scrupulous/bin/
scrupulous".

If you prefer to install Scrupulous e.g. to /usr/local, run

sudo python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local \
                             --install-lib=/usr/local/share/scrupulous \
                             --install-data=/usr/local/share

You can then run it by invoking "/usr/local/bin/scrupulous", or just by 
"scrupulous", if the installation path you chose has a "bin/" subdirectory
that is part of your system's path (as is /usr/local/bin).

External dependencies required:

 * Python 2.7
